# Traffic Sign Recognition System using CNN for Autonomous Vehicles

## Overview
This project aims to develop a robust Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR) system leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for autonomous vehicles. The system accurately detects and classifies various traffic signs in real-time, enhancing navigation safety and efficiency.

## Key Features
- High Accuracy: Achieves over 95% accuracy in detecting and classifying traffic signs.
- Robustness: Demonstrates reliability across diverse environmental conditions, including different lighting, weather, and occlusion scenarios.
- Real-Time Processing: Processes traffic sign images in real-time, enabling swift responses by autonomous vehicles.
- Generalization: Exhibits excellent generalization, accurately recognizing unseen traffic signs.
- Integration: Seamlessly integrates into autonomous vehicle platforms, enhancing overall navigation.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/traffic-sign-recognition.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Prepare dataset: Acquire a comprehensive dataset of traffic sign images and preprocess them.
2. Train model: Design and train the CNN model using prepared dataset.
3. Evaluate performance: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
4. Integration: Integrate the trained model into autonomous vehicle platforms for real-time traffic sign recognition.
